# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT) Gameplay

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT) offers a nuanced take on the timeless classic, introducing strategic depth through its intricate gameplay mechanics. Here's a comprehensive overview of the gameplay:

- **Board Configuration:** The game board comprises 9 smaller Tic-Tac-Toe grids meticulously arranged in a 3x3 layout.

- **Initiating Moves:** The game unfolds as the first player strategically places their mark (X or O) within any cell of any smaller grid.

- **Sequential Gameplay:** Each move dictates the subsequent board where the opposing player must engage. For instance, if the first player positions their mark in the top-right cell of a small grid, the next move must take place in the corresponding top-right small grid.

- **Continual Progression:** This sequential pattern persists, with each move within a small grid dictating the next active grid within the larger framework.

- **Victory Conditions:** Winning a small grid requires achieving a sequence of three marks in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, in keeping with the traditions of Tic-Tac-Toe.

- **Overall Triumph:** Securing victory in the larger game necessitates conquering three small grids in a row, aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Strategic Flexibility:** In the event that a player's move is directed towards a small grid already won or filled, they retain the liberty to choose any unclaimed grid for their next move.

- **Game Conclusion:** The game reaches its conclusion upon the triumph of a player in the larger board or when no legal moves remain, resulting in a draw.
